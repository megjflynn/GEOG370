    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>You can write a paragraph here</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this projection the sizing and area of the continents are accurate for the most part, however, the shape is not. There is distortion in the shape at the poles. </h3>

    <img src=".//maps/4326.png" alt="WGS84" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has distortions in both size and shape. Area appears larger at the poles and at the far left and right edges of the map. The shape also becomes distored as you move away from the center.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54043.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54043.png" alt="Aitoff" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Psuedo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The shape is accurate in this projection however the size becomes distored as you move away from the equator towards the poles.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/3857.png">
    <img src=".//maps/3857.png" alt="Psuedo Mercator" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map projection displays minor distortions in shape and size. Towards the poles, area is distored slightly large and more ellipsoid than spherical.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/53018.png">
    <img src=".//maps/53018.png" alt="Sphere Winkel" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>Size appears accurate in this projection but shape is distored significantly. At the poles the shapes are stretched significantly.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54034.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54034.png" alt="World Cylindrical Equal Area" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection changes both shape and size of the map as you go from the center outward. The center of the map is very spherical and as you go towards the edge it becomes large and more of an ellipse.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="World Equidistant Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is similar to the last. As you move away from the center the circles are stretched into ellipes and are made larger.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/102016.png">
    <img src=".//maps/102016.png" alt="North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Africa Sinusoidal Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this map, shape is distorted. In contrast to previous maps, as you move toward the poles the circles are strecthed virtically rather than horizontally.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/102011.png">
    <img src=".//maps/102011.png" alt="Africa Sinusoidal" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Van der Grinten I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves shape well but the sizing is slighlty distorted as it moves towards the poles.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54029.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54029.png" alt="World Van der Grinten I" width='500px'>
